## "What are things I can do early at the start of building a website from scratch, to make the code more modular, flexible, and organized?"
---
- I asked this question, and I will follow the answer.
- I will start from a blank page and build a web application.

# 🛠️ ScrapeWorks v0 — Project Initialization, tooling & environment
📅 **Release Date:** July 1, 2025

# 📢 Developer's Notes - **git init, npm init, directory setup**
---
- I made a new repository. I'm building a web app and I want it to scrape public information from business-related websites to build leads for a freelancing website developer
- I've been building with repositories that were already initialized, I forgot how to git init & npm init process, but muscle memory kicked in
- I setup the .env & .gitignore despite only being a static webpage at the moment
