## Lessons learned


## "What are things I can do early at the start of building a website from scratch, to make the code more modular, flexible, and organized?"
---
- I asked this question, and I will follow the answer.
- I will start from a blank page and build a web application.

# üõ†Ô∏è ScrapeWorks v0.1 ‚Äî MVP functionality testing
üìÖ **Release Date:** July 2, 2025

# üì¢ Developer's Notes - ****
---
- I learned you can `npm run dev` and connect to <strong>TWO</strong> localhosts on different ports!!!
    - Using `npm run dev` when on `frontend` directory will deploy the website to localhost on port 5173
    - Using `npm run dev` when on `backend` directory will deploy the website to localhost on port 3000
    - While live on localhost:5173, I am sending a POST request to the `/api/scrape` route on the frontend 
        - While also live on localhost:3000, I am listening for POST requests on the `/api/scrape` route on the backend 
            - This interaction is the concept of how to deploy a React frontend on one service (Netlify) & deploy the backend/API on another service (Railway) and have them tie into one web application.

# üõ†Ô∏è ScrapeWorks v0 ‚Äî Project Initialization, tooling & environment
üìÖ **Release Date:** July 1, 2025
---
# üì¢ Developer's Notes - **git init, npm init, directory setup, linter, formatter, scaffold backend**
---
- I made a new repository. I'm building a web app and I want it to scrape public information from business-related websites to build leads for a freelancing website developer
- I've been building with repositories that were already initialized, I forgot how to git init & npm init process, but my muscle memory kicked in
- I set up the .env & .gitignore despite only being a static webpage at the moment
- I will be using ESLint & Prettier as a linter and formatter
- I am using MVC architecture & I will set up my folders to match React projects
- I am using normalize.css, so styling is consistent 
- I filled up my `<head>` element, added Google Fonts & Icons from FontAwesome
- I installed express & got a server up
    - Installed morgan for logging, express-validator for input validator & sanitization
- I installed dotenv & mongoose
    - Got a LeadSchema planned and DB_STRING connected to MongoDB
- I created two directories-- frontend & backend. 
    - One of the main reasons this is done is because React has separate dependencies (node_modules) than the backend
    - It also keeps the project organized and still follows MVC architecture
- I created a Vite + React project 
- I installed Tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer
    - Ran into an error and couldn't initialize tailwindcss with npx
        - I created the tailwind.config.cjs & postcss.config.cjs manually
- Express does not render a React frontend the same way as a templating language like EJS, pug, or Handlebars
    - I will be using Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
